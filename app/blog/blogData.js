      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>In today's digital-first world, your website is often the first impression customers have of your business. But if your website isn't mobile-friendly, you might be losing more than half of your potential clients. Research shows that over 70% of web traffic now comes from mobile devices. If your website doesn't adapt to smaller screens, slow connections, or modern browsing habits, you're pushing customers straight to your competitors.</p>
      <h3>Why Mobile-Responsive Websites Matter</h3>
      <p>Your website isn't mobile-friendly? Then it's not user-friendly. In 2025, over 70% of web traffic comes from phones — if your site doesn't adapt, your audience won't stay.</p>
      <h2>Better User Experience </h2>
      <p>Mobile users expect websites that load fast, fit their screens, and are easy to navigate.</p>
      <h2>Higher Google Rankings </h2>
      <p>Google prioritizes mobile-friendly websites in search results, meaning a responsive site gives you an SEO advantage.</p>
      <h2>Increased Conversions </h2>
      <p>A mobile-optimized site ensures smoother checkout, better lead form submissions, and ultimately more sales.</p>
      <h2>Brand Credibility </h2>
      <p>Businesses with outdated, clunky websites appear less trustworthy.</p>
      <h3>Real-World Example</h3>
      <p>Imagine you run a restaurant.</p>
      <span>1. A potential customer finds your site on their phone but can't read the menu properly or click to call. </span>
      <span>2. They leave.  </span>
      <p>Now imagine the same scenario with a responsive site—smooth browsing, fast booking, and instant calls. </p>
      <span>1. That's the difference responsive design makes </span>
